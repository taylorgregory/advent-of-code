Eric Wastl's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is 'an Advent calender of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and sill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like'. Eric has been producing these riddles since 2015, and in this repository, I solve these in Python.
