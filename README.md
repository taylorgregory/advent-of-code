# advent-of-code
Eric Wastl is 'an Advent calender of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and sill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like'. Eric has been producing these riddles since 2015, and in this repository, I endeavour to solve these in JavaScript. Eric's Advent of Code can be found at www.adventofcode.com.
